# rj-site-router

## Why

Setting up the NGINX config and getting it to work right for an ever expanding list of services became tiresome.

This is effectively a low maintenance and highly configurable reverse proxy tailored to fit in the scheme of my back-end setup.

## What

The router takes route information from the [Uyghurs](https://github.com/the-rileyj/uyghurs) project, updates routes internally as needed, then serves further requests accordingly.
